# JavaScript Tic Tac Toe

This is a JavaScript logic based tic tac toe game. Just like in the regular game, two players take turns placeing either an 'X' or an 'O' on the game grid and the JavaScript logic takes care of determining win or tie scenarios.
Once there is a tie or a win, you can clear the board and start a new game by clicking the reset button.
The game keeps track of each player wins.
